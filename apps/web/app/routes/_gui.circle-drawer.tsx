        Implementing the circle drawer felt similar to the CRUD application
        since it also involves managing a collection of recordsâ€”in this case,
        circles on a canvas. However, the main difference here is the inclusion
        of
        {' '}
        <Strong>undo/redo</Strong>
        {' '}
        functionality, which adds a new layer of
        complexity.

      <Text mb="4" as="p" size="3">
        I used a
        {' '}
        <Strong>snapshot-based approach</Strong>
        , where each action,
        like creating a circle or adjusting its size, stores the entire current
        state of the canvas and makes a new copy with appending new state
        changes. A disadvantage of this approach is that it can become
        memory-intensive as the number of snapshots increases when there are
        numerous circles and circle changes.

        A better more memory-efficient approach would be to utilize a stack of
        actions. Instead of storing the entire state after every change, we
        record the specific actions performed (e.g., &quot;add circle,&quot;
        &quot;update circle&quot;) and use these actions to reverse or reapply
        changes. This method consumes significantly less memory because it only
        tracks the necessary steps to modify the state rather than duplicating
        the entire state each time.
